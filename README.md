# work-image

Possibly useful vim image with a bunch of tools I use preconfigured

## usage

` docker build .  `

A few things to do post build
  - for some reason I can't get vim-go to fetch libraries - run GoInstallBinaries
  - probably then export that container to an image
  - everything that's in packages.sh is added to the image, udpate as needed
